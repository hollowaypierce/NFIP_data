# FEMA NFIP Data Filtering and Mapping

This project demonstrates filtering a data visualization of FEMA NFIP Data.
The code attached uses a specifc event, Hurricaine Helene, to practice vizualizing information from a distinct event. 
While this project is a quick example it provides a jumping off point to investigate a myraid of concepts. Integrating gepsatial and socioeconomic data could potentially reveal intesting narratives and findings.
Potential data sources that could be pulled from are parcel databases, landuse data, population and demographic data, or even overlaying the map with flood extents. 

## Overview
This map displays:
- Total number of FEMA claims per block group
- Average year of building construction
- Average percent of flood damage paid
- Breakdown of claims by FEMA flood zones

Interactive tooltips provide key stats for each polygon.
